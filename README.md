# DnD-Dice-in-Java-
I made this as a tiny programming exercise where I made dice for DnD. You can roll any amount of dice of any type at once, and you can even add the total together! Frankly the program is kinda useless without being written into something like the Discord API, but who knows, maybe I'll bother to learn JavaScript later down the line.

---------------------
|      Setup        |  
---------------------

1. Place both the Main.java and Dice.java files in the same directory.
2. Open up a command prompt and navigate to the directory using the cd command.
3. Type "javac Main.java" (This will build the program into something that can be executed using the command line.)
4. Run the program using the command "java Main"
